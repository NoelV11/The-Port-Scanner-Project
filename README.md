# The-Port-Scanner-Project

- This is a simple script,simulating the port scanning feature that is performed by pentesting tools such as Nmap and Gobuster.Additionally,it is a great project to for anyone wanting to start off learning Python


## Functionalities:-
- Port Scan - Withing a specific range of ports specified by user
- Ability to translate an IPv6 address to an IPv4 one
- Code Commenting has been done where necessary,providing better clarity for learners

## User Input format

- For IP Address - xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx  (You can also enter 1,2 or 3 digit octets to scan)
- For Ports -  xxx-xxx (Scanning 1,2,3,4 and 5 digit ports are also possible)

## Script Run requirements:-
- Python3 or higher  - (apt update  ,  apt install pip ,   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py  ,   python get-pip.py  , apt install python3)
- Any scripting software (gedit,nano or vim)

## Improvements
The following improvements can be done,to the script:-

- Ability to save the scan results (using -o switch)
- Ability to load scanning scripts specific for a port
- Provide more verbose information on ports and the target machine 

## Parting Notes

- I do hope that you have the same amount of fun,that I had,while coding this script!
- This repository is open to the public,to collaborate and contribute.Get in touch with me and I would be more than happy
